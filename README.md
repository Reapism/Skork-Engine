**Skork Engine** is the sequel to the original [Skork](https://github.com/Reapism/Skork) project.

## See Updates for changelog

## What is the Skork Engine
**Skork** (SCORE-K) is a custom programming language for writing a game with rules *you define*. Skork allows you to test code in a 
visual way using *sprites*. You can visual your code using primitive variables, loops, and sprites. My audience is anyone 
interested enough to write in a simplified programming language, and visualize code in a different way! Feel free to fork it 
and make any update/addition/deletion you want. 

> ***But remember to do all such activities in accordance to the [current license](https://github.com/Reapism/Skork-Engine/blob/master/LICENSE).***

## All Skork related repositories.
Three distinct projects! 
* *Skork Engine framework itself! (private)*
* **Web based implementation of the Skork Engine Framework.**
* *Cross platform app using Xamarin (coming soon)*

# FAQ 
### Is the Skork engine open sourced?
This project itself is open sourced. This refers to the Web-based implementation of the Skork Engine, and the **interaction** with the Skork-Engine framework. The *actual* Skork framework is **not open sourced**. Since the rebirth of this project, I decided this project
fits better with a data driven model. This means all profiles, preferences, (possibly) and projects will be in the cloud.
An emphasis on a database model for this software means that database connectivity, and manipulation *shouldn't* be public (for
security reasons).

### What is the Skork Engine framework?
It's the barebones API for parsing text into Skork code, compiling it, interpreting it, and running it! The Skork framework
is responsible for delegating, managing, and executing resources based on the priortity of each task or instruction it interprets.
This project is an **implementation** of the framework. The compiled framework will be available for use with its own license through
GitHub or NuGet (coming soon). By itself, it doesn't do much of anything. It needs an application to implement it. 

### What is Skork Engine used for?
Since its a programming language, technically, its uses are up to you. What makes this simplified programming language
different than the others is that it is revolved around **sprites** which are a visual indicator of your code. Overtime, 
there will be other **"entities"** you can instantiate and interact with! You can create a "game" with a ruleset you define
statically or dynamically through code. It provides an easy way to visualize a ruleset or function.

### Design goals?
* Guided by SOLID principles
* Agile as software development methodology
* Test Driven Development(TDD) development process
* Simple (User friendly naming and documentation)

### What is Future of the Skork Engine
I want to develop this engine to the maximum. Possibly to be part of something bigger. This may include this software being aquired
by a third party.
